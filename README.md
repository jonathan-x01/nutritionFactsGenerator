# nutritionFactsGenerator
Ever wanted to create your own nutrition facts label? Well, with this tool you can. This tool helps calculate the calories from the energy input you give it.

Don't want to download it? That's okay. All of my client-side projects have a demo page so you can try it on the web rather than downloading it.
Demo: https://jonathan-x01.github.io/nutritionFactsGenerator/

Planned Features:
1.) Save & load
2.) The ability to add more vitamins
3.) Template page generator to print large quantities
4.) Download the nutrition facts label as an image
